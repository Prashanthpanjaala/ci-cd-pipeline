# CI/CD PIPELINE AUTOMATION




TASK 1: Automate Code Deployment Using CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)
‚Ä¢	Objective: Set up a CI/CD pipeline to build and deploy a web app.
In this project, we leverage Jenkins to create a robust CI/CD pipeline that integrates tools like Docker,  and OWASP Dependency Check to deliver secure and high-quality software.
Tools used:
1.	GitHub
2.	Jenkins
3.	Docker Hub
4.	Docker
5.	nodeJS
  



GITHUB:
 GitHub is a platform for hosting and sharing code using Git. It helps developers collaborate by tracking changes, managing versions, and reviewing code. You can create repositories(repos) to store and organize projects. It also offers features like issue tracking and CI/CD workflows.

 
 


 JENKINS:
Jenkins is an automation tool for building and deploying software. It uses pipelines to automate tasks like testing, building, and deploying code. It supports plugins to integrate with various tools. Jenkins makes Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) easy.




DOCKER:
Docker is a tool to create, share, and run lightweight virtualized environments called containers. Containers package code and dependencies together for consistent behavior across systems. It simplifies app deployment and avoids ‚Äúit works on my machine‚Äù issues. Docker images are reusable blueprints for containers.




NODE.JS:
Node.js is a runtime that lets you run JavaScript outside the browser. It‚Äôs great for building fast and scalable server-side applications. Node.js uses non-blocking, event-driven programming for high performance. It‚Äôs commonly used for web servers, APIs, and real-time apps.





CI/CD WORKFLOW:
‚Ä¢	The pipeline automates build, test, and deploy processes, making it efficient and reliable.
‚Ä¢	Security and quality checks are seamlessly integrated into the pipeline, ensuring every release is both secure and robust.



In Jenkins, **webhooks** are commonly used to trigger Jenkins jobs based on events occurring in external systems, such as GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. Webhooks allow Jenkins to automatically start a build when certain events, like code pushes, pull requests, or branch updates, happen on the external system.

### Setting up Webhooks in Jenkins:

1. **Install the necessary plugins:**
   To use webhooks, ensure you have the appropriate plugins installed in Jenkins. For Git-based systems, this typically involves:
   - **GitHub Plugin**
   - **GitLab Plugin**
   - **Bitbucket Plugin**
   These plugins handle the integration between Jenkins and the respective platform.

2. **Create or configure a Jenkins job:**
   You‚Äôll need to create or configure a Jenkins job (usually a pipeline or freestyle job) that will be triggered by the webhook. This job typically contains the steps that Jenkins will execute when the event occurs.

3. **Configure the webhook on your external system (e.g., GitHub):**
   - For **GitHub**, go to the repository‚Äôs settings > Webhooks > Add webhook.
   - In the **Payload URL**, enter the Jenkins webhook URL. This will generally be something like:  
     ```
     http://<jenkins-server>/github-webhook/
     ```
   - Set the content type to `application/json`.
   - Choose which events should trigger the webhook (e.g., push events, pull requests, etc.).
   - Finally, save the webhook.

4. **Configure Jenkins to handle the webhook:**
   Jenkins will need to listen for incoming webhooks, and this is usually done using the **GitHub Plugin** or **GitLab Plugin**. Once you have set up your Jenkins job:
   - Go to the job configuration.
   - Under **Build Triggers**, enable the trigger option that corresponds to the external service, such as **GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling** or similar options for GitLab or Bitbucket.

5. **Test the webhook:**
   Once everything is set up, push changes to the external system (e.g., commit code to GitHub). The webhook should notify Jenkins, and it should automatically trigger the configured job.

### Example: GitHub Webhook in Jenkins

1. Install the **GitHub plugin** in Jenkins.
2. Create a Jenkins job (e.g., a Freestyle or Pipeline job).
3. In the Jenkins job configuration, under **Build Triggers**, check **GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling**.
4. Copy the webhook URL generated by Jenkins (it should look like: `http://<your-jenkins-server>/github-webhook/`).
5. In your GitHub repository, navigate to **Settings > Webhooks**.
6. Add a new webhook, set the Payload URL to the Jenkins webhook URL, and select the events that should trigger the webhook (usually "Push events").
7. Save the webhook, and now Jenkins will automatically trigger a build whenever the selected event occurs on GitHub.

### Use Cases:
- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Automatically trigger builds when new code is pushed.
- **Pull Request Builds:** Trigger builds when a pull request is created or updated.
- **Branch Builds:** Trigger builds when changes are made to specific branches.

By using webhooks, you can integrate Jenkins with external platforms to automatically trigger builds and streamline your CI/CD pipeline.



MINIKUBE : Minikube is a tool that lets you run **Kubernetes locally**.

Here‚Äôs the breakdown:

### üîß What it does:
- It creates a **single-node Kubernetes cluster** on your **local machine**.
- Great for **development**, **testing**, and **learning** Kubernetes without needing a cloud provider or full cluster.

### üì¶ How it works:
- Minikube runs a **virtual machine** (or container) on your machine.
- Inside that VM, it installs and configures Kubernetes and Docker.
- You get a fully working Kubernetes cluster that you can interact with using `kubectl`.

### ‚úÖ Why you‚Äôd use it:
- You're learning Kubernetes.
- You want to test deployments locally.
- You need a quick way to simulate a cluster without cloud costs or setup.

### üöÄ Key features:
- Supports Docker, containerd, or CRI-O as the container runtime.
- Can mount local folders into the VM.
- Comes with dashboard support (`minikube dashboard`).
- Supports **addons** like Ingress, metrics-server, etc.

KUBERNETES -BASED CANARY DEPLOYMENT WITH K3S AND ISTIO
---

## üöÄ **Project Overview**
You're setting up a **canary deployment strategy** using **K3s (lightweight Kubernetes)** and **Istio service mesh** to:
- Deploy two versions of an app
- Split traffic dynamically (e.g., 80/20)
- Monitor app performance
- Adjust traffic (promote or rollback)

---

## üß∞ **Tools Stack**
| Tool     | Purpose |
|----------|--------|
| **K3s**  | Lightweight Kubernetes cluster |
| **Istio**| Traffic routing, telemetry, canary deployment |
| **Docker**| Containerize your apps |
| **Helm** | Manage K8s manifests |
| **Node.js/Python** | Base app (2 versions) |

---

## üèóÔ∏è **Step-by-Step Breakdown**

### 1. üîß **Set Up K3s Cluster**
Install K3s locally or on VM:

```bash
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -
kubectl get nodes
```

### 2. üê≥ **Containerize App (2 Versions)**
Create Dockerfiles for both versions (`v1`, `v2`) of your app.

Example (Node.js):

```Dockerfile
# Dockerfile
FROM node:18
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm install
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

Build and push:
```bash
docker build -t yourrepo/app:v1 .
docker build -t yourrepo/app:v2 .
docker push yourrepo/app:v1
docker push yourrepo/app:v2
```

---

### 3. üì¶ **Deploy App to K3s**
Create a Kubernetes `Deployment` and `Service` for your app.

#### `app-deployment.yaml`
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: app-v1
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp
      version: v1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myapp
        version: v1
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: app
        image: yourrepo/app:v1
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3000
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: app-v2
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp
      version: v2
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myapp
        version: v2
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: app
        image: yourrepo/app:v2
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3000
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: myapp-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: myapp
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 3000
```

---

### 4. üåâ **Install Istio**
```bash
curl -L https://istio.io/downloadIstio | sh -
cd istio-*
export PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH
istioctl install --set profile=demo -y
```

Enable automatic sidecar injection:
```bash
kubectl label namespace default istio-injection=enabled
```

---

### 5. üåê **Istio Gateway & VirtualService for Traffic Splitting**

#### `istio-gateway.yaml`
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: myapp-gateway
spec:
  selector:
    istio: ingressgateway
  servers:
  - port:
      number: 80
      name: http
      protocol: HTTP
    hosts:
    - "*"
---
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: myapp-destination
spec:
  host: myapp-service
  subsets:
  - name: v1
    labels:
      version: v1
  - name: v2
    labels:
      version: v2
---
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: myapp-virtualservice
spec:
  hosts:
  - "*"
  gateways:
  - myapp-gateway
  http:
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: myapp-service
        subset: v1
      weight: 80
    - destination:
        host: myapp-service
        subset: v2
      weight: 20
```

---

### 6. üìà **Monitoring & Metrics**
Enable **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, **Kiali**, and **Jaeger** in Istio:

```bash
istioctl dashboard kiali
istioctl dashboard grafana
```

Monitor request metrics, error rates, latency.

---

### 7. üîÅ **Rollout Strategy**
- Observe canary version (`v2`) performance
- If successful: increase traffic (e.g., 50/50, then 100/0)
- If poor: rollback (0% to `v2`, 100% to `v1`)

Update weights in `VirtualService` YAML or use `kubectl patch`.
